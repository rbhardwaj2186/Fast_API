FastAPI is a powerful and modern Python framework specifically designed for building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It excels in creating RESTful APIs, a popular architectural style for web services. Here's what makes FastAPI stand out:

    Speed:  One of its biggest strengths is speed. FastAPI is known to be incredibly fast, rivaling frameworks written in languages like Node.js and Go. This efficiency makes it a great choice for high-performance applications.

    Developer Friendly:  FastAPI is built with developer experience in mind. It boasts a clean and intuitive syntax that makes code easy to read, write, and maintain. Additionally, FastAPI leverages type hints, a feature built into Python, to automatically validate data and generate documentation. This reduces errors and saves you time.

    Automatic Documentation: Speaking of documentation, FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation based on your code. This makes it easy for others to understand how to interact with your API.

    Production-Ready: FastAPI is not just for development. It's built to be robust and secure, making it perfectly suitable for deploying your APIs to production environments.

This repository focuses on using FastAPI to create AI projects. Given FastAPI's strengths in speed, ease of use, and automatic documentation, it becomes a great tool for building and deploying AI-powered applications.
